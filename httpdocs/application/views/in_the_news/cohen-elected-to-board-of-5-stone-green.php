<p>Ned H. Cohen, founder and president of NHCohen Partners LLC, has been elected to serve on the Board of Advisors of 5 Stone Green Capital, a real estate investment fund focused on sustainability and the use of clean energy.</p>
<p>“Ned’s proven skills in building new businesses and understanding the concerns of investors as a fiduciary will make a valuable contribution to the growth of 5 Stone Green Capital,” said Doug Lawrence, founder and co-managing principal of the real estate fund.</p>
<p>“We look forward to his business acumen and capital markets expertise, as well as his thoughts about attracting investors and supporters who understand the attributes of investing in green real estate assets in particular, and real estate funds in general.”</p>
<p>Cohen will serve on a board that includes General Wesley Clark, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe; Stuart Brodsky, principal creator of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star program; and two past chairmen of branches of the Federal Reserve Bank: David Chen, now a principal of Equilibrium Capital Group; and Thomas Mackell, Jr.</p>
<p>Said Cohen, “There is a growing recognition within the real estate community that buildings can have a significant effect on the environment. It’s a privilege to serve on the board of a company at the forefront of efforts to ensure that these effects are positive.”</p>
