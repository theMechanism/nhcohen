<p>Demonstrating the utility of real estate capital formation through syndication, NHCohen Partners has concluded a raise of $8.5 million to enable investors to buy a 475-unit multifamily portfolio in Tennessee.</p>
<p>Consisting of three properties, the portfolio was purchased for $35 million by an affiliate of CapStack Partners LLC and MACC Venture Partners from Lennox Companies, a New York-based seller.</p>
<p>The assets include The Vista 205-unit property in downtown Nashville, Fawnwood Apartments (158 units) and Archwood Meadows (112 units), both in suburban Madison. Built between 1973 and 1979 they average 95 percent occupancy.</p>
<p>Ned Cohen, president of NHCohen Partners commented, “Providing passive equity is in many circumstances a desirable and efficient way to fill the gap between conventional financing and sponsor’s equity. The investor members contribute equity in exchange for a preferred return and tax benefits, such as favorable long-term capital gains among other potential features.”</p>
<p>CapStack and MACC intend to renovate and reposition the Nashville portfolio and refinance upon stabilization, a move that should result in a return of a substantial portion of the investor capital, according to Cohen.</p>
