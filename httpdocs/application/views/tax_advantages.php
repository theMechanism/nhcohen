<p>Investments in real estate through limited partnership or limited liability company investment entities may provide many tax related benefits including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Potential for property appreciation</li>
	<li>Favorable long-term capital gain rates upon sale</li>
	<li>Possible tax-deferred distributions from excess mortgage refinancing proceeds</li>
	<li>Distributions that may be partially tax sheltered resulting in increased after-tax returns</li>
	<li>Investment tax credits on qualifying expenditures for properties that undergo extensive improvements</li>
	<li>Estate tax savings attributable to minority interest valuation discounts based on IRS acceptance of lack of marketability of non-publicly traded limited partnership interests in real estate investments</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all investments in real estate provide tax advantage benefits.  There is no assurance that there will not be legislative or administrative changes in the tax laws that may adversely affect tax benefits of real estate investments.  Because tax laws are subject to change, your accountant or tax advisor should be consulted before proceeding with any investment and to determine if a contemplated investment is appropriate. </p>
