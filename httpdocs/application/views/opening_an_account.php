<h2>Important Information About Procedures for Opening a New Account</h2>
<p>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.</p>
<p>This Notice answers some questions about our Customer Identification Program.</p> 
<h2>What types of information will I need to provide?</h2>
<p>When you open an account, we are required to collect information such as the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your name 
	<li>Date of Birth 
	<li>Address 
	<li>Identification Number  
		<ul>
			<li>U.S. Citizen: taxpayer identification number (social security number or employer identification number)</li> 
			<li>Non-U.S. Citizen: taxpayer identification number, passport number, and country of issuance, alien identification card number, or government-issued identification showing nationality, residence, and a photograph of you.</li> 
			<li>You may also need to show your driver's license or other identifying documents.</li> 
		</ul>

</ul>
<p>A corporation, partnership, trust or other legal entity may need to provide other information, such as its principal place of business, local office, employer identification number, certified articles of incorporation, government-issued business license, a partnership agreement or a trust agreement.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of the Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission, FINRA, and the New York Stock Exchange rules already require you to provide most of this information. These rules also may require you to provide additional information, such as your net worth, annual income, occupation, employment information, investment experience and objectives, and risk tolerance.</p>
